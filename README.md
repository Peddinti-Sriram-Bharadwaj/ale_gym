# Atari Learning Environment (ALE) Interfacing Example

This project demonstrates a basic interaction with the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) using the `ale-py` library. It provides a simple example of how to load a ROM, interact with the environment, and get the game score.

## Project Overview

The `interfacing.py` script provides a minimal example of interacting with an Atari game ROM using the `ale-py` library. It does the following:

1.  Loads an Atari ROM file.
2.  Sets a random seed for reproducibility.
3.  Plays a single episode of the game, taking random actions.
4.  Prints the total score at the end of the episode.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3:** This project requires Python 3.
*   **`ale-py`:** The Python interface for the Atari Learning Environment.
*   **Atari ROM:** You'll need an Atari ROM file (e.g., `breakout.bin`). Please note that you must legally obtain the ROM files.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```
    (If you are not using git, just navigate to the directory)

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the dependencies. You can also install the dependencies directly with `pip install ale-py`)

## Usage

1.  **Place ROM File:**
    *   Place your Atari ROM file (e.g., `breakout.bin`) in the same directory as `interfacing.py`.

2.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python interfacing.py breakout.bin
    ```
    Replace `breakout.bin` with the name of your ROM file.

    **Note:** If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the script.

## Project Structure

*   **`interfacing.py`:** The main Python script that interacts with the ALE.
*   **`.gitignore`:** Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (in this case, the `.rl_ale/` directory).
*   **`requirements.txt`:** Lists the project's dependencies and their versions.

## .rl_ale Directory

The `.rl_ale` directory (which is ignored by Git) is intended to be used for any temporary files, logs, or data generated during the execution of your reinforcement learning experiments.
