# Atari Learning Environment (ALE) Interfacing Example

This project demonstrates a basic interaction with the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) using the `ale-py` library. It provides a simple example of how to load a ROM, interact with the environment, and get the game score.

## Project Overview

The `interfacing.py` script provides a minimal example of interacting with an Atari game ROM using the `ale-py` library. It does the following:

1.  Loads an Atari ROM file.
2.  Sets a random seed for reproducibility.
3.  Plays a single episode of the game, taking random actions.
4.  Prints the total score at the end of the episode.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3:** This project requires Python 3.
*   **`ale-py`:** The Python interface for the Atari Learning Environment.
*   **Atari ROM:** You'll need an Atari ROM file (e.g., `breakout.bin`). Please note that you must legally obtain the ROM files.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```
    (If you are not using git, just navigate to the directory)

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the dependencies. You can also install the dependencies directly with `pip install ale-py`)

## Usage

1.  **Place ROM File:**
    *   Place your Atari ROM file (e.g., `breakout.bin`) in the same directory as `interfacing.py`.

2.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python interfacing.py breakout.bin
    ```
    Replace `breakout.bin` with the name of your ROM file.

    **Note:** If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the script.

## Project Structure

*   **`interfacing.py`:** The main Python script that interacts with the ALE.
*   **`.gitignore`:** Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (in this case, the `.rl_ale/` directory).
*   **`requirements.txt`:** Lists the project's dependencies and their versions.

## .rl_ale Directory

The `.rl_ale` directory (which is ignored by Git) is intended to be used for any temporary files, logs, or data generated during the execution of your reinforcement learning experiments.

## TD Blackjack

This project implements a text-based version of the classic card game Blackjack, referred to here as "TD Blackjack".  It allows a single player to play against a dealer, following standard Blackjack rules.

**Key Features:**

*   **Standard Blackjack Rules:** The game adheres to the core rules of Blackjack, including hitting, standing, doubling down (when applicable), and dealer hitting on soft 17.
*   **Text-Based Interface:** The game is played entirely through the command line, providing a simple and accessible interface.
*   **Card Representation:** Cards are represented using standard suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and ranks (Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King).
*   **Dealer Logic:** The dealer's actions are automated according to standard Blackjack strategy.
* **Betting:** The player starts with a set amount of money, and can bet on each hand.
* **Win/Lose/Push:** The game correctly determines if the player wins, loses, or pushes (ties) against the dealer.

**How to Play:**

1.  Run the `blackjack.py` script.
2.  The game will prompt you to place a bet.
3.  You will be dealt two cards, and the dealer will be dealt one face-up card and one face-down card.
4.  You will be prompted to "hit" or "stand".
5.  If you choose to "hit", you will be dealt another card.
6.  If you choose to "stand", the dealer will reveal their face-down card and play their hand.
7. The game will determine the winner.
8. The game will continue until the player runs out of money, or quits.

**Files:**

*   `blackjack.py`: Contains the main game logic.
* `cards.py`: Contains the card and deck logic.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   **Multiple Players:** Expand the game to support multiple human players.
*   **Splitting:** Implement the ability to split pairs.
*   **Insurance:** Add the option for insurance bets.
* **GUI:** Create a graphical user interface.
